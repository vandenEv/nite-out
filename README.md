## ⚙️ Setting up NGROK

Sign up for [NGROK](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken). You will receive your own [Auth Token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken). Once done, run the following in cmd prompt:

```sh
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

> **⚠️ Important:** NGROK must be added to System Path variables for this to work. Scroll down to Troubleshooting if you encounter issues!

## 🏃‍♀️‍➡️ Running the Project

Once setup is complete, run the following commands, each in **their own** cmd prompt window:

### Backend (Flask)

```sh
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: ./venv/Scripts/Activate
python main.py
```

### NGROK

```sh
ngrok http 8080
```

Copy the generated **Ngrok URL** and update the frontend/mobile/environment.js file:

![NGROK URL](https://i.imgur.com/XOGls3i.jpeg)

Inside environments.js:

```sh
API_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
```

### Frontend (React Native)

```sh
cd frontend/mobile
npx expo start
```

**Scan the QR code in Expo Go to test on your phone.**

> **⚠️ Important:** Your **laptop and phone** must be on the **same Wi-Fi network** to test the mobile app!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Windows setup file not working

You might encounter the error "running scripts is disabled on this system". To enable running scripts in PowerShell run the following:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
```

### Setup file stopped working?

-   After running the setup file once make sure to open a new powershell window for it to work

### No module named ...

Make sure you have requirements installed by running this inside the backend folder:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Virtual environment not activating?

Try running:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
./venv/Scripts/Activate     # Windows
```

### Python/Pip/Ngrok not found even though it's installed?

This is a very common issue on Windows. It is caused when the installation process doesn't update the system's PATH environment variable.
For Python & Pip:

-   If Python is installed using the default settings, it should be found in: C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX (where XX is the version)

For NGROK:

-   The NGROK.exe will be by default found in your downloads folder. You will need to create a folder somewhere safe that you will be able to access easily.
-   After creating this folder you will need to move the NGROK.exe file from your downloads to this new folder. For example "C:\Program Files\ngrok" where ngrok is the name of the folder and inside is ngrok.exe

Adding to System Path Variables:

-   Open system variables by searching "environment variables" in the windows search and clicking the "Environment Variables..." button.
-   Under System Variables, scroll down and find "Path" and then click edit. Click new and then paste corresponding path to the module you are pissing (one new entry per path):

```
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\  # When Python is not recognized
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Scripts\  # When pip is not recognized
C:\Users\YourUsername\YourPathToNgrok\  # When NGROK is not recognized

```

-   Click "OK" to save

### Ngrok error?

-   Ensure your Flask server is running **before** starting Ngrok.

### Expo not detecting your device?

-   Make sure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.

### Expo not building/Lan Issues?

Try running:

```sh
npx expo start -tunnel
```
